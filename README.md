----📦 Cardboard Logistics System (Logistics/Warehouse Module)----
This application represents one of four interconnected modules that form a complete, fully operational enterprise system. The small applications communicate with each other primarily through a central database, exchanging and retrieving information in real-time.

The system is designed to simulate a corporate information program focused on managing cardboard order fulfillment.

----Application Role and Target Users----
This specific module is designated for Logisticians and Warehouse Staff. Its primary function is to manage the flow of finished goods from the production stage to final shipment.

----Core Functionality----
The application enables users to perform the following critical logistics and inventory tasks:

- Receive Completed Production Orders: Logisticians process and formally accept finished cardboard orders from the production department, moving the items into designated warehouse stock.

- Update Warehouse Inventory (Stock Management): Users dynamically update the inventory status in the central database, reflecting accurate stock levels after receiving production items and fulfilling customer orders.

- Organize Shipments: The module facilitates the organization of outbound logistics, allowing staff to prepare and assign finished goods for specific customer shipments.

- Generate Reports (Real-Time Reporting): The system provides real-time reports concerning the current warehouse inventory status and detailed records of completed shipments.

In summary, this application serves as the operational backbone for managing the finished goods inventory and outbound shipment processes within the overall cardboard order fulfillment workflow.
